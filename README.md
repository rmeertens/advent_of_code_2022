# Advent of Code 2022 - solutions by Roland Meertens
Another year, another advent of code! I am using Python, as I am quite familiar with this language. As a personal achievement I managed to get onto the public leaderboard once this year ðŸ¥³. 

This year I decided to record myself solving the problems and put that on Youtube. Although I am not an amazing programmer I hoped I could inspire people to improve their programming skills in some way or another. For some days I don't have a recording for a various number of reasons (wrong input screen selected, screen frozen, recording broken, me talking with my dad half of the time, etc.). 

My workflow includes using Github Copilot. This helped me a lot in the earlier days, and not at all with the more difficult puzzles. Copilot works especially well when coding boiler-plate functions and implementing common operations. I believe that AI-assisted coding is the future of the trade of software engineer, and encourage anyone to try it out!
